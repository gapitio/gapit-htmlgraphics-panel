### Halved the saved options

:::caution
Breaking change! `importedPanelOptions` doesn't save in the options after v2.0.0.
:::

:::caution
Panels created after updating to v2.0.0 will have the halved size, but plugins created before v2.0.0 must have it's `importedPanelOptions` updated. To update `importedPanelOptions` go to the [Import/export](options.md#importexport) option and update the json (add a space at the bottom of the editor) and save (ctrl+s).
:::

The `importedPanelOptions` doesn't save as it's own option anymore, but just updates the other options. Which almost halves the size of the saved panel options.

### Improvements to the mutate calcs options

A bug was fixed where import/export didn't update with the latest mutate calcs options when mutate calcs changed.

All the calcs which are in use are shown in the calcs option.
